            <h3>2. General Notes and Mandatory Information</h3>
            <h4>Data Protection</h4>
            <p>The operators of these pages take the protection of your personal data very seriously. We treat your personal data confidentially and in accordance with statutory data protection regulations and this privacy policy.<br>

              We point out that data transmission over the internet (e.g., communication by email) can have security gaps. Complete protection of data against access by third parties is not possible.</p>
